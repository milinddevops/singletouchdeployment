# Single Touch Deployment

This is an concept to implement the end-to-end deployment with no manual intervention. This is the continues process with 100% automation, this ensures application sanity, correctness, vulnerability scans, containerization, deployments. 

This ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) will increase the efficiency of application deliverables.

## Overview
In single-touch-deployment process, the deployment is automatically triggered. The development environment release is triggered within the CICD pipeline, which is initiated by code push or tag creation master branch. In case of stage and production deployment, the deployment trigger is based on the approval machnism, typically it is ServiceNOW.

Fixed and repeatetive process of application build, scan, and deploy. Environments specific manifest used in the deployment cycle. The manifest details can be changed easily & quickly as per release. Dedicated process for each steps, which makes it maintainalble and scaleble. 

The process comprise with collection of specialized application release automation platform. This automatic deployment system simplified the application deployment tasks and mitigate risk making complex and manual operations, reliable, repeatable and error-free. This helps to accelerate the time-to-release and effectivly reduces the toil.


## Tools stack

### Jenkins
This tool is very integral part of single-touch-deployment. In this tool the shared-library is used, you can find all the functions definations in the jenkins-shared-library directory. 

### maven
This is java application tool to build the app. It prepares the required artifactory for the deployment. Maven is also trigger the the sonar scan.

### JUnit
This is the unit testing tool which runs the test cases to generate the code coverage and code sanity report on sonarqube portal

### SonarQube
This tool is used to run the code sanity checks, which generates the consolidated reports on the portal. It also has the quality gates which ensure that code pass all checks.

### Docker
Docker is used for containerization, this will ensure that the application dependencies and other libraries are packaged inside and image which will entually deployed as container in Openshift cluster.

### Ansible
Playbooks are the tasks which are there to do the deployment, SNOW ticket creation, start the Rundeck jobs. These playbooks are the key turning point in all of the automation, it also has the python scriipt combinaton which makes it more robust.

### Selenium
This tool is used in the crucial stage of the ALM cycle to make the decision to move ahead in the deployment.

### ServiceNOW
ServiceNow as always been the workflow management tool to get the required approval from the application stake holders.
